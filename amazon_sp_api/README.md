# Amazon Selling Partner API Integration

This project provides a Python interface for interacting with the Amazon Selling Partner API (SP-API). It includes functionality for OAuth authentication and creating product listings on Amazon.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. You can download Python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the source code.
2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Configuration

Set the following environment variables with your Amazon SP-API credentials:

- `AMAZON_CLIENT_ID`: Your Amazon SP-API client ID.
- `AMAZON_CLIENT_SECRET`: Your Amazon SP-API client secret.
- `AMAZON_REFRESH_TOKEN`: Your Amazon SP-API refresh token.

These can be set in your environment or through a `.env` file.

### Usage

To use the script to create a product listing, run `main.py` with the path to a JSON file containing the product data:

```bash
python main.py /path/to/product_data.json

```
